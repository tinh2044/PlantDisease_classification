## Introduction

In the context of increasingly modernized agriculture, the application of technology to optimize cultivation processes and protect crops from diseases is more urgent than ever.I are pleased to introduce the Plant Disease Classification System, an advanced solution that combines artificial intelligence (AI) and modern web technology to help farmers timely identify and address various crop diseases.

## Dataset

Data is collected from various sources on kaggle and aggregated together. The dataset is split into train, val, and test. With 102 diseases of 20 plants, Another version of this dataset is split into 20 plants and each plant is split into train, val, test with corresponding diseases.
